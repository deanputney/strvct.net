<!--
: A Flexible User Interface for Naked Objects
-->

## Introduction

By exposing domain objects directly to users and automatically generating user interfaces, naked objects aimed to simplify and accelerate software development. However, despite these advantages, the adoption of naked objects has been largely limited to internal tools and prototypes do to the usability limitations of the automatically generated user interfaces. While functionally complete, these interfaces often lack the user inteface patterns and visual appeal expected in end user applications. This paper describes a new approach to address many of these limitations and introduces a new open source JavaScript client-side framework which implements it.

- the automation of UI generation requires a _scalable_ solution which implies:
- small set of components
- wide range of layouts
- elegantly handling wide rande of layouts, navigation depths, display sizes

- not all existing UIs can map directly to scalable components
  -- not all existing UIs are well designed
  -- can we capture the patterns of good design?
  e.g. hierachy

- Brief recap of naked objects concept
- Identification of the usability limitations in previous naked object systems
- Statement of the problem: need for more elegant and usable interfaces for end users
- Objectives of the new system

## Evolution of User Interfaces for Object-Oriented Systems

### Early Object-Oriented User Interfaces

- Smalltalk's direct object manipulation
- IBM's Common User Access (CUA) guidelines

### The Model-View-Controller (MVC) Pattern

- Separation of concerns in user interfaces
- Impact on object-oriented system design

### Conventional Business System Interfaces

- Form-based and process-oriented interfaces
- Disconnect between UI and underlying object model

### Previous Naked Object Systems

- Direct representation of domain objects
- Limitations in usability and aesthetics
- Confined to internal tools and prototypes

### Recent Trends in UI Design

- Material Design, Fluent Design, and other modern UI paradigms
- Increased focus on user experience and aesthetics

## Introducing STRVCT

### Core Principles

- Maintaining direct object representation
- Enhancing visual design and user experience
- Balancing object-oriented purity with usability

### Key Features of the New System

- Describe innovative UI elements that improve usability
- Explain how the system maintains naked object principles
- Detail any new patterns or techniques developed

### Implementation Approach

- Description of the framework or tools developed
- Explanation of how UI generation is handled
- Discussion of customization options for different domains

### Potential Benefits

- Improved end-user adoption and satisfaction
- Maintaining agility and rapid development of naked objects
- Bridging the gap between developer and user mental models

### Challenges and Solutions

- Handling complex object relationships in the UI
- Balancing automation with design flexibility
- Supporting different types of end-users (novice to expert)

### Case Studies or Examples

- Demonstration of the system applied to real-world scenarios
- Comparison with previous naked object implementations

## Discussion

- Reflection on how the new system addresses previous limitations
- Consideration of implications for object-oriented system design
- Potential impact on development processes and methodologies

## Conclusion and Future Work

- Summary of key contributions
- Identification of areas for further research and development
