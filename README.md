# Strvct

Strvct is a client-side JavaScript framework for creating single page web applications using a [naked objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naked_objects) system in which only the domain model objects need to be defined and the user interfaces and storage are handled automatically.

**NOTE:** This project is currently under active development, has very limited documentation, and is not yet ready for production use.
