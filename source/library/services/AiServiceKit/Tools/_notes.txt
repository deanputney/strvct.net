⏺ I understand now. With an additional class to manage ToolDefinitions, the structure would be:

  1. ToolDefinitions - Manages the registry of available tool definitions
    - Stores all available ToolDefinition instances
    - Methods for registering/unregistering tools
    - Generates tool definition sections for system prompts
    - Provides lookup/filtering of available tools
  2. ToolDefinition - Definition of a specific tool
  3. ToolCalls - Manages active/historical tool calls
    - Tracks all ToolCall instances
    - Handles persistence, error recovery, and state management
    - Provides the developer UI for inspecting calls
    - Manages the lifecycle of ToolCall instances
  4. ToolCall - Instance of a specific tool invocation
  5. ToolResult - Result of a tool execution

  This separation makes sense - one class manages the available tools, and another manages the instances of those tools being used.

> and a ToolResult instance would be owned by a ToolCall instance

⏺ Correct. The ownership hierarchy would be:

  1. ToolCalls (manages collection of tool calls)
    - Contains many ToolCall instances
  2. ToolCall (specific invocation)
    - References its ToolDefinition (what tool is being called)
    - Owns its ToolResult (result of the call)
    - May have multiple historical responses if retries occurred

  The ToolResult being owned by its ToolCall maintains a clean object model where:
  - Each response knows which call created it
  - The call history is preserved (especially important for error handling/retries)
  - Responses are properly scoped to their specific invocation

  This structure also makes persistence and serialization more straightforward since the entire call object graph can be saved and restored.
